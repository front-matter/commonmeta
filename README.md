# commonmeta
commonmeta is a Go library to implement Commonmeta, the common Metadata Model for Scholarly Metadata. Use commonmeta to convert scholarly metadata, in a variety of formats, listed below. Commonmeta is work in progress, the first release was on April 19, 2024. Implementations in other languages are also available ([Ruby](https://github.com/front-matter/commonmeta-ruby), [Python](https://github.com/front-matter/commonmeta-py)).

commonmeta uses semantic versioning. Currently, its major version number is still at 0, meaning the API is not yet stable, and breaking changes are expected in the internal API and commonmeta JSON format.


## Supported Metadata Formats

Commonmeta reads and/or writes these metadata formats:
