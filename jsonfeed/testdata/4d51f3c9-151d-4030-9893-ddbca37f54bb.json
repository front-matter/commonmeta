'Link\nrot' -- broken links -- and 'content drift' -- where a link works but\ntakes you to something other than the original content -- are both\nproblems, albeit less so than for the web at large.

The Matrix of the Commons -- found\nat]{style=\"font-weight:400;\"}\n[[www.scholarlycommons.org]{style=\"font-weight:400;\"}](http://www.scholarlycommons.org/)[\n-- is the result of work on how to get us from here to there, via a\nguiding set of decision trees on how to treat a range of digital\nentities appropriately and consistently. Important take home messages\nwere that we should all assume 1) that our tools will be used in\nconjunction with other systems and 2) that they should be built for\ndrivers, not mechanics.]{style=\"font-weight:400;\"}\n\n## [THOR round-up]{style=\"font-weight:400;\"}\n\n[Between keynote talks, THOR partners presented highlights from the\nproject deliverables over the course of two sessions. In the first,\nMaaike Duine (ORCID) summarised THOR's communications activities and\nAmbassador programme. Elizabeth Hull presented DRYAD's perspective on\nlinking data and publications. Martin Fenner (DataCite) looked at\nclaiming workflows to ORCID. Robin Dasler spoke both about analysis\npreservation at CERN and THOR's analyses of PID service adoption. Robert\nPetryszak (EMBL-EBI) talked on how to realise the full potential of PIDs\nin the biosciences, and the session closed with a demo of dynamic data\nidentification in the earth and environmental sciences from Markus\nStocker (PANGAEA).]{style=\"font-weight:400;\"}\n\n![Pic\n2](https://thorproject2014.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/pic-2.png?w=958&h=581){.alignnone\n.size-full .wp-image-1762 attachment-id=\"1762\"\npermalink=\"http://project-thor.eu/2017/11/24/thors-last-hurrah/pic-2/\"\norig-file=\"https://thorproject2014.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/pic-2.png\"\norig-size=\"958,581\" comments-opened=\"0\"\nimage-meta=\"{\\\"aperture\\\":\\\"0\\\",\\\"credit\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"camera\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"caption\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"created_timestamp\\\":\\\"0\\\",\\\"copyright\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"focal_length\\\":\\\"0\\\",\\\"iso\\\":\\\"0\\\",\\\"shutter_speed\\\":\\\"0\\\",\\\"title\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"orientation\\\":\\\"0\\\"}\"\nimage-title=\"Pic 2\" image-description=\"\" image-caption=\"\"\nmedium-file=\"https://thorproject2014.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/pic-2.png?w=300\"\nlarge-file=\"https://thorproject2014.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/pic-2.png?w=958\"\nloading=\"lazy\" width=\"958\" height=\"581\"\nsrcset=\"https://thorproject2014.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/pic-2.png 958w, https://thorproject2014.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/pic-2.png?w=150&h=91 150w, https://thorproject2014.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/pic-2.png?w=300&h=182 300w, https://thorproject2014.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/pic-2.png?w=768&h=466 768w\"\nsizes=\"(max-width: 958px) 100vw, 958px\"}\n\n*[Image: PID service adoption study]{style=\"font-weight:400;\"}*\n\n[After lunch, Tom Demeranville (ORCID) gave updates on developing tools\nfor federated identity management and better use of organisation\nidentifiers. Martin Fenner returned to share outcomes from a joint\nTHOR-OpenAIRE workshop on article-data linking. Angela Dappert (British\nLibrary) considered the challenges of embedding persistent identifier\nservices within the humanities. Sünje Dallmeier-Tiessen (CERN) fed back\nfrom a high-energy physics community workshop. Lastly, Maaike Duine\nreported on insights gathered from a focus group meeting to envision the\n'ideal PID world' for publishing workflows.]{style=\"font-weight:400;\"}\n\n## [Points for discussion]{style=\"font-weight:400;\"}\n\n[It wouldn't have been a THOR event without the opportunity for everyone\nto participate, and the mid-afternoon panel session provided a dedicated\nforum. Panellists Hannah Hope (Wellcome Trust), Clifford Tatum (CWTS),\nAndres Mori (Digital Sciences), Erika Bilicsi (Library and Information\nCentre of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences) and chair Adam Farquhar\naddressed comments and questions from the\nroom.]{style=\"font-weight:400;\"}\n\n![Photo\n3](https://thorproject2014.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/photo-3.png?w=1200&h=447){.alignnone\n.size-full .wp-image-1761 attachment-id=\"1761\"\npermalink=\"http://project-thor.eu/2017/11/24/thors-last-hurrah/photo-3/\"\norig-file=\"https://thorproject2014.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/photo-3.png\"\norig-size=\"1200,447\" comments-opened=\"0\"\nimage-meta=\"{\\\"aperture\\\":\\\"0\\\",\\\"credit\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"camera\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"caption\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"created_timestamp\\\":\\\"0\\\",\\\"copyright\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"focal_length\\\":\\\"0\\\",\\\"iso\\\":\\\"0\\\",\\\"shutter_speed\\\":\\\"0\\\",\\\"title\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"orientation\\\":\\\"0\\\"}\"\nimage-title=\"Photo 3\" image-description=\"\" image-caption=\"\"\nmedium-file=\"https://thorproject2014.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/photo-3.png?w=300\"\nlarge-file=\"https://thorproject2014.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/photo-3.png?w=1024\"\nloading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"447\"\nsrcset=\"https://thorproject2014.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/photo-3.png 1200w, https://thorproject2014.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/photo-3.png?w=150&h=56 150w, https://thorproject2014.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/photo-3.png?w=300&h=112 300w, https://thorproject2014.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/photo-3.png?w=768&h=286 768w, https://thorproject2014.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/photo-3.png?w=1024&h=381 1024w\"\nsizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\"}\n\n*[Photo: Discussion panel on PID use in different\ncommunities]{style=\"font-weight:400;\"}*\n\n[Discussion points included the relative underuse of funder IDs,\nidentifying a current difficulty in capturing full information for works\ninvolving multiple funders as a possible stumbling block. A question on\nhow best to approach differences of opinion, e.g. between co-authors\nfaced with article- or data-retraction, provided useful food for\nthought. Changing our general view was suggested as a potential way\nforward given that not all retractions are equal and the reasons may\nwell be mundane, rather than issues of capability. Also covered were the\nconcepts of PIDs as a compromise between the readability needs of human\nand machine, and of the importance of working out which features of an\nobject are the most critical to identify.]{style=\"font-weight:400;\"}\n\n[Important take-homes from the day were that PID space is developing at\nan active and encouraging pace and that we should stay alert to idea\nthat, in terms of policy, one size may not fit\nall.]{style=\"font-weight:400;\"}\n\n[Finally, Simon Lambert (STFC) looked ahead to the FREYA project, which\nwill follow on from THOR, starting on 1 December 2017. One of its key\nstrands is to achieve long-term sustainability for the outstanding\nprogress and development that began with ODIN -- THOR's predecessor --\nand advanced significantly during the 30 months of\nTHOR.]{style=\"font-weight:400;\"}\n\n## [Want to know more?]{style=\"font-weight:400;\"}\n\n[Presentation slides from the day are available for\ndownload:]{style=\"font-weight:400;\"}\n\n- [Herbert van de Sompel's\n  keynote](https://www.slideshare.net/hvdsomp/achieving-link-integrity-for-managed-collections)\n- [Fiona Murphy's keynote and THOR partner presentation\n  slides](https://zenodo.org/communities/2017-15-11-thor-final-event/?page=1&size=20)\n",
